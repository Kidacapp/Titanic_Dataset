# Titanic Dataset using Bayesian Network


The Titanic Dataset has gained significant popularity in the field of data analysis and machine learning, particularly for classification tasks. Traditionally, algorithms such as Logistics Regression and Decision Tree have been widely employed to predict the survival outcome of passengers aboard the ill-fated Titanic. However, in this study, we aim to take a different approach by leveraging the power of Bayesian Networks for this classification task.

Bayesian Networks, also known as belief networks or probabilistic graphical models, offer a unique framework for modeling complex relationships among variables. Unlike traditional algorithms that rely on explicit mathematical equations or decision rules, Bayesian Networks utilize probability theory to capture and represent the dependencies and conditional relationships between variables. This allows for a more intuitive and flexible modeling approach, especially in scenarios where the relationships between variables are not easily discernible.

By utilizing a Bayesian Network for the Titanic Dataset, we can effectively model the interplay between various factors such as passenger demographics, ticket class, cabin location, and family relationships, among others, to predict the likelihood of survival. The probabilistic nature of the Bayesian Network enables us to incorporate uncertainty and account for missing or incomplete data, providing a more robust and reliable prediction mechanism.


In conclusion, our study aims to explore the application of Bayesian Networks to the Titanic Dataset for classification purposes. By leveraging the inherent advantages of Bayesian Networks, such as their ability to model complex relationships, handle uncertainty, and provide interpretability, we hope to achieve accurate and insightful predictions regarding the survival of Titanic passengers.
